SHOPS
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is of
high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are 
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

    experience points. If killing a monster of lower level you'll gain
    less experience points

must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"

very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But we have worked
out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution we
    can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

"BERSERK"

Warrior only

Usage : berserk

싸우는 도중에 할 수 있는 기술로 광폭 전사가 되어 싸우게 됩니다.
적이 죽을 때까지 미친듯이 공격을 합니다. 이 상태가 되면 전사의
공격 데미지가 현격하게 향상이 되며, 대신 적을 맞출 수 있는 능력은
떨어지게 됩니다. 적이 죽을 때까지는 도망을 치지 않고 싸우게 됩니다.
무기를 들고 있는 경우에만 데미지가 증가됩니다.

#
"REMORTAL"

Usage : 모든 class

단군의 경우 한번에 한하여 직업을 바꿀 수가 있습니다.
Remortal은 olympus에서 이루어집니다. Remortal을 하기 위해서는
단군이 되는 exp의 절반이 소모됩니다. 그리고 Remortal 당시의
체력이 1500이 넘어야 합니다.

Remortal을 하게 되면 현재 exp가 0가 되고, level이 1로 됩니다. 
Level up을 할 때 hit, mana, move, prace number의 증가는 없습니다.
예전 직업에서 배운 spell level을 넘어감에 따라서 예전에 배웠던 
spell을 사용할 수가 있습니다. 예를 들어, cleric에서 warrior로 바꿨을
경우 level 8이 되면 예전에 배웠던 poison이라는 spell을 사용할 수가
있습니다. 새로운 class에서 배운 spell의 경우 mana 소비량이
증가됩니다. 예를 들어, detect invisiblity를 배운 warrior가 cleric이 
되었을 경우, cleric의 level이 30이 될 때까지는 더 많은 mana 소비를
하게 됩니다.

hide, backstab, kick 등과 같은 skill의 경우 위력의 차이는 있지만
처음 level부터 사용이 가능합니다.  Extra damading의 경우 backstab에는 
적용이 되지 않습니다.  Mage spell 중 full fire와 throw의 성공률은 
처음 char가 mage가 아니면 1/2 감소합니다.

즉, 기존의 skill이나 spell은 penalty없이 사용 가능, 새로 배운 skill이나
spell은 penaly가 존재합니다. 아이템은 원래 class에 따라서 입을 수
있습니다.

Remortal의 장점:
  두 class의 skill을 동시에 사용 가능하다.

Remortal의 단점:
  바뀐 class의 spell을 쓸 경우 mana 소비가 증가한다.
  바뀐 class의 backstab, multi kick, quadruple, double등의 효과가 원
  class보다 못하다.

#
"Rent"

Coconut Mud에는 rent fee가 있습니다. Rent를 하거나 접속이 끊어지고 일정
시간이 지난 후에는 자동으로 item들이 보관되게 됩니다. 이 아이템을 찾기
위해서는 Rent room(from mid, seu)에서 retrieve 명령을 사용하시면 됩니다.

Rent 방에서 이용 가능한 명령으로는

Rent - 물건은 rent하고 게임을 끝낼 경우
Offer <item|all|inv||equip|rent> - Rent한 물건 가격을 조사할 경우
Retrieve - Rent한 물건을 찾을 경우, 17시간이 지난 경우에는 Rent fee가
    절반으로 19시가인 지난 경우에는 Rent fee를 물지 않고 물건을
	찾을 수가 있습니다. 

향후 Rent fee 변경 계획:

현재는 맡긴 물건이 얼마나 오래되었는지에 상관없이 일정한 rent fee가
부가되었으나 향후에는 물건을 맡긴 기간에 따라 rent fee를 차등 부가할
계획입니다. 예를 들어 knee를 하루 맡긴 경우 1000원 이라면, 이틀동안 맡긴
경우(즉, 맡기고 이틀동안 retrieve를 안한 경우)는 2000원 하는 식으로
부가할 예정입니다. 세부적인 차등 비율을 추후 조절할 예정입니다.
결과적으로 창고 char를 운영하는데 돈이 많이 들어갈 수 있습니다.

창고 char를 아예 금지 시키는게 아니고 창고 char은 위에서 언급한 대로
할인 시간 대에 retrieve하고 rent를 하시면 됩니다(이러면 맡긴 시간이 다시
reset되겠죠) 아니면 단군에게 무상공급되는 아파트를 이용하시면 됩니다.
아파트에는 개인 보관함이 있어서 개인보관함에 보관되는 물품을 무료로 저장,
또는 인출할 수 있습니다. 대신 아파트에 보관하는 물품을 mud내에 존재하는
물품으로 인식되기 때문에 item의 regen에는 영향을 미칩니다.

추후 rent비를 일정 금액 정도 깍아주는 credit card item을 mud에내
추가할 계획이 있습니다.  아직 어떤 mob에게 credit card를 맡길지는
결정을 하지 못했습니다.
